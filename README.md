# Gauss-algorithm
This project contains alogrithms to the equations with Gauss algorithm in C++14.

There are 4 main methods to do this:
1. W/o swapping column and/or rows. This won't work if there is 0 on the diagonal.
2. W/ swapping rows. Works if there's 0 on the diagonal.
3. W/ swapping columns. Works if there's 0 on the diagonal.
4. W/ swapping columns and/or rows when needed. The most optimal way to use.

The matrix is read from a csv file.
The example file can be found in this repository.
